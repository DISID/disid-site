Spring Roo was created to make design time code generation approaches to RAD excel: be easy to use,
generate editable code, and produce high-quality, high-performance,
and portable enterprise applications written in 100% Java.

Code generation, as an approach to RAD, is proven method to encapsulate best
practices and reduce hand-written, boilerplate code.

DISID takes over the leadership of the open source framework http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/[Spring Roo].
After the partnership agreement with Pivotal, DISID constitutes
the main Spanish developer company of this agile development framework for Java.
