DISID has developed R&D Project of "Research and experimental developmen of an
automatic generation system of information systems based on Open Source
technology from behavioral patterns". This project has been financed by IVACE,
The Valencian Institute of Business Competitiveness of Valencian Government,
through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), inside Operational
Programme (ERDF) of the Community of Valencia for the period 2014‐2020.


The aim of the project is to develop a software solution which will allow
transform tailor-made information systems with propietary technologies to open
source-based technological environments.
The scope of the project is divided into 4 areas:

. Reverse engineering of source system deploying with Oracle Developer Suite family of products.
. Source system specifying to structured notation.
. New automatic generation system of information.
. Generated information system open source-based technologies.

[.col-md-6]
Within the diversity of propietary systems we chose as a first goal of the
project *the information system developed with _Oracle Developer Suite_* due to
thehuge numbers of applications (millions of lines of code) that they are still
in operation without a clear prospect for migrating to a new environments due to
their high cost. These are complex and critical systems that save all companies
core business.

[.col-md-6]
As an open *system to run generated information system we chose the _JEE_
platform*, nowadays the most widespread and standardised in the sector.
Finally, http://www.gvnix.org[gvNIX], the open source Java development
environment recently chosen as standard for Java development of the Generalitat
Valenciana, was chosen as the development platform where components and
algorithms for automatic generation of applications will be implemented.

The main technical challenge of the project has been to cover the technology gap
 between systems by implementing set of reverse engineering processes which allow
 to analysis of the code, documentation and the behavior of the system which
 will be migrated to identify their components and dependencies with the aim of
 drawing a system abstraction that will serve as entry to set of code generation
  tools which allow to generate a new system semi-automatically with the same
  behavior of previous system but running with a different technology.

            <p>The objective of the project was to develop a software solution that would allow
            the transformation of information systems developed with proprietary and non-compatible
            technologies to open-source software environments that could make use of market-based
            services that were advantageous, so that technically feasible and the return on investment is guaranteed.</p>
            <p>To do this the <em>"Add-on Scene"</em> an <em>OSGi</em> component that fits perfectly into the
            environment <em>Spring Roo</em> and <em>gvNIX</em>, providing the new required functionality is created.</p>
            <p>We are proud of the technological innovation of the project where the proposed
            solution has one of its strengths in transforming systems developed with proprietary
            technologies into systems developed with open source technologies.
            This new business line will open a new framework of collaboration
            between companies of the Valencian Community.</p>
            <p>An important advantage for potential users of the solution, both economically
            and technically and functionally, can become active participants in development communities.</p>
            <p>Currently the costs of such a migration are so high that they are comparable to
            re-developing the entire application. That is why many organizations do not even raise it.</p>
            <p>This is why with this project DISID, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.pentec.es/">Pentec</a>,
            we have succeeded in semi-automate the migration process of this type of systems,
            reducing costs at a high level, opening a Market of thousands of systems migrations
            that are in this situation.</p>
            <p>The project has been developed as <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/">Spring Roo</a>
            <em>"Add-on Scene"</em> and as part of the features that the new version of
             <a href="http://www.gvnix.org/">gvNIX</a> will offer.</p>
