gvNIX is an open source tool for agile Java development (RAD) applications that
allows developing applications in just a few minutes.

It is a distribution of Spring Roo that provides the set of Spring Roo tools plus
a suite of features that increase development productivity and improve the user experience
by integrating frameworks like jQuery, Bootstrap 3, Leaflet, DataTables, Dandelion DataTables, among other.

A development environment which includes support to create applications
with geographic component Geo, allowing a fast development of geoportals
for visualization and data management.

gvNIX consolidates as standard for Java development of the DGTI of the Generalitat Valenciana.

We are committed to implant gvNIX both government and the private sector. We are currently in the lead in developing gvNIX.

Widely known and successful experience in the development in open source projects,
we taught different seminars on the use of gvNIX environment development.
