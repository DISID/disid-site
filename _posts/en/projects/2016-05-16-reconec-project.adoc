A solution for recognition, localization and tracking of persons in real time.
It also provides adequate information to each user based on their location and
the characteristics of the environment in which it is located, representing the
location of the individual plan on a graphic interface based on gvSIG 2.0.

It consists of software and infrastructure necessary to integrate technologies
of real-time location (RFID), enterprise resource management (ERP) and geographic
information systems (gvSIG) to present unified information combining geospatial
data with data from the organization in which the solution is deployed.

The IMPIVA and the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, Government of Spain
and invest in our platform integration of sensors in real-time reconnecting.
